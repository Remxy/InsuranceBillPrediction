# InsuranceBillPrediction
An insurance company wants to improve its cash flow forecasting by better predicting patient charges
using demographic and basic patient health risk metrics at the time of hospitalization.

This app is for Predicting patient's bill using PyCaret Package.

The objective is to build and deploy a web application where the demographic and health information of a patient is entered into a web-based form which then outputs a predicted charge amount.
